# Module 11: Web Scraping and Data Analysis Assignment 

## Background

In this assignment, the focus was on leveraging web-scraping techniques and data analysis skills to extract valuable information from the Mars News website and analyze Mars weather data. The assignment aimed to reinforce core skills such as data collection, organization, storage, analysis, and communication of insights.

## Deliverables

### **Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News**

- Utilized automated browsing with `Splinter` to visit the Mars News site and extracted `HTML` code using `Beautiful Soup`.
- Successfully scraped and extracted titles and preview text of Mars news articles.
- Organized the scraped information into a Python data structureâ€”a list of dictionaries.
- Optional: Explored the possibility of sharing the data by exporting it to a `JSON` file.

### **Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data**

- Employed automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site and identified `HTML` elements for scraping.
- Utilized `Beautiful Soup` to extract data from the HTML table and assembled it into a `Pandas DataFrame`.
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Mars weather data, addressing questions related to months on Mars, Martian days' worth of data, temperature, atmospheric pressure, and terrestrial days in a Martian year.
- Created meaningful data visualizations (bar charts) to support and communicate the analysis.
- Exported the resulting DataFrame to a `CSV file` for further use. Please reference `mars_data.csv`. 

## Files and Instructions

- Downloaded necessary files from the provided [Module 11 Challenge files](https://example-download-link.com).
- Executed tasks outlined in Jupyter Notebooks, following instructions for each deliverable.

## Conclusion

This assignment provided a hands-on opportunity to apply learned skills in web scraping and data analysis to real-world scenarios. By successfully completing both deliverables, the assignment reinforced the ability to collect, process, and analyze data, as well as present findings visually. The use of tools like Splinter, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas showcased a holistic approach to web scraping and data manipulation.
